## SWBProcess
SWB Process is the Business Process Management System (BPMS) part of the SemanticWebBuilder (SWB) products suite. The main focus of SWB Process is to provide an agile platform for business process automation, business process monitoring and tracking through the application of the Semantic Web technologies and standards. In this sense, SWB Process allows to model, configure, execute and track business process cases as defined in the Business Process Management (BPM) approach, while keeping all execution data in an standard and interoperable format such as RDF.

## SWBProcess Technology

As SWB Process was built using the SWB Platform, it applies Semantic Web standards (RDF and OWL) to drive process management and to persist process execution data, adding meaning to the process diagrams and making explicit the knowledge involved with business objects. This provides mechanisms to build a corporate knowledge base and to make business processes interoperate with other IT solutions and systems.

For the modeling, execution and interchange of business process models, SWB Process uses the BPMN 2.0 standard.

## SWBProcess components

### SWBProcess Modeler
Graphical business process modeler which uses the BPMN 2.0 standard to allow business analysts to design business process flows. It provides means to export the designed diagrams to several standard formats.

### SWBProcess Documenter
Allows to generate online business process documentation to enable final users and process performers to understand and adopt business processes in the organization. This component is specially useful in the early stages of BPM (business process discovery and documentation).

### SWBProcess Configurator
Allows to define the execution details for each element of a business process model and to relate custom semantic items with the defined business objects.

### SWBProcess FormsBuilder
Allows to quickly design the capture forms that will be part of the user interfaces for User tasks. It reuses the properties of the custom semantic items to accelerate forms definition and configuration.

### SWBProcessEngine / TaskInbox
State-machine semantic engine responsible for the execution and deployment of executable process models and the orchestration of process activities. It provides a user space to organize user work load.

### SWBProcess Monitor
Provides a global or particular view of process execution performance based on response times and user participation by showing charts and dynamic tables to business analysts.

### SWBProcess Reports
Provides a mechanism to define custom reports on process execution and performance data, allowing business analysts and stakeholders to gain business knowledge and help decision making.
